THIS IS THE ENTIRE DOCUMENTATION FOR THIS SOFTWARE. IF YOU ARE UNCOMFORTABLE
PROCEEDING, STOP! THERE IS NO OTHER DOCUMENTATION, NO OTHER HELP. THE
SOFTWARE IS DESIGNED FOR INTERMEDIATE TO ADVANCED USERS.

PHPMailer-ML is a Mailing List and Email Communications management tool. It is
designed to show how to use PHPMailer and process everything from one single
email to a database of subscribers. You are using this at your own risk ...
you should test this before putting in ANY environment.

Requirements:
- PHP version 4.2.3 and up
- MySQL (three tables, they are created automatically)
- Requires your own SMTP server (GMail will also work)
  - note: we recommend using Sendmail for small to medium size mailing lists

Features
- Uses PHPMailer as the email transport class (to support PHP4)
- GPL license (changed in version 1.1)
- Supports unlimited mailing lists
- Supports unlimited subscribers for each list
- Supports unlimited email templates with previews (2 included)
- Administration control panel with HTTP authentication to control access
- Default list for newsletter has 'listid' 1
- Default subscribe form in root directory feeds default newsletter list
- Subscription process has double-blind opt-in
- Confirm process is part of double-blind opt-in (confirms email address)
- Unsubscribe process requires a portion of the link be encrypted
- Campaign message editor is WYSIWYG and tested on all popular browsers
- Supports URL based images
- Supports HTML and Text messages, or Text Only messages
- Supports storing messages (multi-edits) and save/send
- Supports auto-stripping HTML to create text portion of message using HTML2Text

Installation
1. After unzipping the files, edit the "_acp-ml/inc.settings.php" file
   you will need:
   - your SMTP server settings (if you plan on using SMTP)
   - your MySQL settings
   * if you are unusure about anything up to this point, do not continue
     get someone to help you
2. Upload the files to a directory on your site
3. Secure the "_acp-ml" directory using _acp-ml/.htaccess and _acp-ml/.htpasswd
   A sample is provided. Please change the password in .htpasswd,
   the default (password) is not secure. You can generate another password
   using the tools at http://www.codeworxtech.com/ under the Resources menu
   (Create htpasswd)
4. To use the new import functionality, create a _acp-ml/files/ directory off the root of
   your PHPMailer-ML installation and make the directory writable

Notes:

- if you are using the CSV upload functionality, keep in mind you have a limit
  on the size of files that you can upload. The default maximum is 2 Mb. You can 
  increase this through your .htaccess file:
  
  php_value post_max_size "50M" 
  php_value upload_max_filesize "50M" 
  
  (would increase the maximum file size to 50 Mb. (or whatever you set it to)
  * this cannot be set in the script through ini_set()
  
- the PHP default for script execution time is 30 seconds. In many cases, this is
  not enough time to process medium to large mailing lists. You can extend execution
  time in a loop with:
  set_time_limit(30); // sets or resets execution time to 30 seconds
  ... or outside of a loop:
  set_time_limit(1800); // sets or resets execution time to 30 minutes
  ... essentialy, the PHP command sets to the number of seconds you define

If you would like to add the subscribe form to an existing page on your site,
add the following form:

<form action="http://www.yoursite.com/yourrootpath/index.php?pg=add" method="post">
First Name: <input type="text" name="first"><BR>
Last Name: <input type="text" name="last"><BR>
Email: <input type="text" name="email"><br>
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

Please provide feedback through the sourceforge.net tracker.
Please, clearly indicate your feedback is for the PHPMailer-ML package, version 1.1.

Enjoy!
